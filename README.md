<!-- OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS -->
## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
![alt text](https://github.com/ramyasnl/Module_9_SurfsUp_Submission/blob/main/2021-04-04%20(2).png)


### Built With

* Jupyter notebook 
* SQLite database



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
We are going to help W.Avy to start an "Surf n Shake" shop in Hawaii by analysing the data in the DB sqLite <br/>
We are using sqlAlchemy for querying databases

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Results
* ## Month of June Temperature Analysis<br/>

![alt text](https://github.com/ramyasnl/Module_9_SurfsUp_Submission/blob/main/2021-04-04%20(4).png)<br/>

In the month of June the average monthly temperature is 74.9 (F), the monthly max temperature is 85.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 64.0 (F).<br/>
With the above information collected we know its a good season for the business .<br/>

* ## Month of December Temperature Analysis<br/>

![alt text](https://github.com/ramyasnl/Module_9_SurfsUp_Submission/blob/main/2021-04-04%20(5).png)<br/>

In December temperature analysis indicates the average monthly temperature is 71.0 (F), the monthly max temperature is 83.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 56.0 (F).<br/>
With this information we can conclude that the business compared to june may slightly lower due to the reduced temperature .<br/>

* ## Overall Result
   Comparing the standard deviation in June  is slightly lowerthan (3.26)  the standard deviation in the December temperature (3.75)<br/>
   Which tells its a good place to start the "Surf n Shake" business ,since the average temperature is almost more than 70(F) even during the winter season .<br/>


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Summary <br/>

* Comparing the two different months with these descriptive statistics suggestes the average temperatures are fairly similar between the summer (June) and winter (December)<br/>   However the ranges of temperatures in June (summer) are quite warmer compared to the ranges of temperature in Decemeber(winter).<br/>
* An additional query we can perform is to get the level of precipitation for the different months and analyse the data. <br/>
* Another query we can do is to  indicate the extreme weather conditions,which can provide maximum safety to the customers and can avoid major loss in the business .<br/>
